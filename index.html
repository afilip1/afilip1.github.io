                    Hi! I'm Anton, a software developer based in Barnaul, Russia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been programming since 2015, and in that time I have worked with many different
                    technology stacks, paradigms and areas of knowledge. I've tried my hand in everything
                    from web development to compiler design, and I am comfortable tackling most engineering
                    challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strive to write readable, maintainable, and performant code with clean architecture
                    and high test coverage.

                <p>
                    I have good experience and can quickly get up to speed with

                        <strong>C/C++</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong> for close-to-the-metal programming;

                        and <strong>SQL</strong> for all my database needs.

                <p>
                    I haven't used in a while, but generally understand

                <p>
                    Over the years I have worked on numerous little projects, most of which you can find
                    on my <a href="https://github.com/afilip1">GitHub</a> and
                    <a href="https://gitlab.com/Yuurai">GitLab</a>. Here are some of the more notable ones:

                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Jute</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/jute">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        A toy programming language made in ~1000 lines of C. Features basic type checking
                        and native execution via LLVM. I had hoped to make a modern successor to C, but alas,
                        writing a compiler in C turned out to be pretty painful. Well, at least it can
                        handle Fizzbuzz.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Minekong</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/minesweeper">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        An aesthetically pleasing implementation of good old Minesweeper in React/Redux.
                        Supports both mouse- and touch-optimized control schemes. Made with the purpose
                        of learning React, but it's honestly quite addictive. Just don't ask about the name.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Seekr</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/Seekr">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        A simple file browser written in Kotlin with TornadoFX. Supports navigation history,
                        deleting and renaming files, updating on detecting external changes and other fancy
                        things. Also a learning project, but it works well.
