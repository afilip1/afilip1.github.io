                    Hi! I'm Anton, a software developer based in Barnaul, Russia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been programming since 2015, and in that time I have worked with many different
                    technology stacks, paradigms and areas of knowledge. I've tried my hand at everything
                    from web- and desktop development to compiler design and microcontrollers, and I am 
                    comfortable tackling most engineering challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strive to write readable, maintainable, and performant code with clean architecture
                    and high test coverage.
                </p>

            <div class="block-inner">
                <p>
                    Currently I primarily use TypeScript with the Svelte framework for web application development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have good experience and can quickly get up to speed with many technologies, including (but not limited to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong> for front-end development;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>C/C++</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong> for close-to-the-metal programming;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Kotlin</strong> for desktop apps and services;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Python</strong> for scripting and data science;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and <strong>SQL</strong> for all my database needs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I haven't used in a while, but generally understand
                    <strong>Haskell</strong>.

                <p>
                    Over the years I have worked on numerous little projects, most of which you can find
                    on my <a href="https://github.com/afilip1">GitHub</a>. Here are some of the more notable ones:
                </p>

                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Jute</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/jute">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        A toy programming language made in ~1000 lines of C. Features basic type checking
                        and native execution via LLVM. I had hoped to make a modern successor to C, but alas,
                        writing a compiler in C turned out to be pretty painful. Well, at least it can
                        handle Fizzbuzz.
                    </p>

                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Minekong</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/minesweeper">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        An aesthetically pleasing implementation of good old Minesweeper in React/Redux.
                        Supports both mouse- and touch-optimized control schemes. Made with the purpose
                        of learning React, but it's honestly quite addictive. Just don't ask about the name.
                    </p>

                <section class="project">
                    <h3>Seekr</h3> <a href="https://github.com/afilip1/Seekr">(github)</a>
                    <p>
                        A simple file browser written in Kotlin with TornadoFX. Supports navigation history,
                        deleting and renaming files, updating on detecting external changes and other fancy
                        things. Also a learning project, but it works well.

                    Over the years I've written and recorded a few music tracks. Have a listen?

                    I'm also quite interested in Japanese culture, and have been studying the language for a few years
                    now.
